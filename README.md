# webdev2
Full stack web application project for the course of Technologies and Programming of Web Applications at AUEB. 
Implemented a book search webpage using the [Penguin Random House](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com) API with additional use cases of saving books as favorites
and managing the favorites list (filtering list results, editing book data, removing books from the list). The favorites list is stored at a remote database ([MongoDB](mongodb.com)).
